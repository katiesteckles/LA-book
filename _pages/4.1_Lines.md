# Lines

Euclid defined a line as having *"breadth-less length"*, which is another way of saying that a line is a one-dimensional object that has a length, but no breadth or volume. Given that we have already taken the time to introduce vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the chapter on [Vectors](vectors-chapter), it makes sense to use them to define a line in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

```{prf:definition} Vector equation of a line
:label: vector-equation-of-a-line-definition

Let $\mathbf{p}$ be a position vector of a point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{d}$ a non-zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The line $\ell$ [^1] which passes through $\mathbf{p}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$ has equation

$$ \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} + t\mathbf{d}, $$(line-vector-equation)

where $\mathbf{r}$ is a point on $\ell$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$ is a **parameter**.
```

[^1]: $\ell$ is used here instead of $l$ to avoid confusing with a 1 or uppercase i.

In other words, every point on $\ell$ is obtained by adding some scalar multiple of the vector $\mathbf{d}$ to the point $\mathbf{p}$ ({numref}`line-vector-equation-figure`). Alternatively, $\ell$ is the line which passes through $\mathbf{p}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$. We call the vector $\mathbf{d}$ a **direction vector** of the line.

```{figure} ../_images/4_vector_equation_of_a_line.svg
:name: line-vector-equation-figure
:width: 500

The position of any point on the line $\ell$ can be obtained by adding a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$ to $\mathbf{p}$.
```

The equation of the line that passes through the two points with position vectors $\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2$ can be determined by using equation {eq}`line-vector-equation` with $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{p}_1$ and $\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{p}_2 - \mathbf{p}_1$. In particular, $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{p}$ are not unique, and we can choose any point on the line for $\mathbf{p}$, and any non-zero scalar multiple of $\mathbf{d}$, to express the same line.

Take for instance the $x$-axis in $\mathbb{R}^3$. $\ell$ can be described as:

$$ \mathbf{r} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, $$

which means we are taking $\mathbf{p} = (0,0,0)$ and $\mathbf{d}=(1,0,0)$ and for example the point with position vector $\mathbf{q} = (5,0,0)$ is found when $t=5$. Alternatively we can describe the $x$-axis as 

$$ \mathbf{r} = \begin{pmatrix} 71 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 71 + 5t \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, $$

which means we are taking $\mathbf{p} = (71,0,0)$ and $\mathbf{d} = (5,0,0)$ and the point $\mathbf{q} = (5,0,0)$ is found when $71 +5t = 5 \implies t = -66/5$.

## Intersecting lines

````{prf:definition} Intersection between two lines

Two lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ with corresponding vector equations $\mathbf{p}_1 + t_1\mathbf{d}_1$ and $\mathbf{p}_2 + t_2\mathbf{d}_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ **intersect** if there exist values of $t_1$ and $t_2$ such that

To determine whether two lines intersect, we can equate the vector equations of the two lines and attempt to solve for $t_1$ and $t_2$.

```{prf:example}
:label: line-line-intersection-example

Three lines $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are defined by the vector equations $(1 + t_1, -3 + 2t_1, t_1)$, $(6 - t_2, -5 + 2t_2, t_2 - 1)$ and $(6 + 2t_3, -11 + 2t_3, -2 - t_3)$ respectively. Determine the points of intersection between the three lines (if possible).

```{dropdown} Solution

Equating $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ gives an equation relating $t_1$ and $t_2$ for each of the three coordinate directions:

$$ \begin{align*}
    1 + t_1 &= 6 - t_2, \\
    -3 + 2t_1 &= -5 + 2t_2, \\
    t_1 &= -1 + t_2.
\end{align*} $$

The third equation can be rearranged to give $t_1 = t_2 - 1$, and substituting this into the first equation gives $t_2 = 3$, and so $t_1 = 2$.

Substituting these values into the second equation gives $-3 + 2 \cdot 2 = -5 + 2 \cdot 3$, which simplifies to $1 = 1$. This means that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ do intersect.

To find the point of intersection we substitute these values of $t_1$ and $t_2$ into the equations for $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ respectively.

$$ \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 + 2 \\ -3 + 2 \cdot 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}  &= \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \\
    \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 3 \\ -5 + 2 \cdot 3 \\ 3 - 1 \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}. \\
\end{align*} $$

So $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ intersect at $(3, 1, 2)$. 

Equating $\ell_1$ and $\ell_3$ gives

$$ \begin{align*}
    1 + t_1 &= 6 + t_3, \\
    -3 + 2t_1 &= -11 + 2t_3, \\
    t_1 &= -2 - t_3.
\end{align*} $$

Substituting the third equation into the first equation gives $1 - 2 - t_3 = 6 + t_3$, giving $t_3 = -7/2$ and $t_1 = -21/2$. Substituting these into the second equation gives $-3 + 2 \cdot (-21/2) = -11 + 2 \cdot (-7/2)$, which simplifies to $-24 = -18$. This is a contradiction, so no values of $t_1$ or $t_3$ satisfy $\ell_1 = \ell_3$, and hence $\ell_1$ and $\ell_3$ do not intersect.

Equating $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ gives the system

$$ \begin{align*}
    6 - t_2 &= 6 + 2t_3, \\
    -5 + 2t_2 &= -11 + 2t_3, \\
    -1 + t_2 &= -2 - t_3.
\end{align*} $$

The third equation gives $t_2 = -1 - t_3$, and substituting this into the first equation gives $6 + 1 + t_3 = 6 + 2t_3$, so $t_3 = 1$ and $t_2 = -2$. Substituting these into the second equation gives $-5 + 2 \cdot -2 = -11 + 2 \cdot 1$, which simplifies to $-9 = -9$, so $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ do intersect. Substituting $t_2$ and $t_3$ into the equations for $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$:

$$ \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix} 6 - (-2) \\ -5 + 2 \cdot (-2) \\ -1 + (-2) \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -9 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}, \\
    \begin{pmatrix} 6 + 2 \cdot 1 \\ -11 + 2 \cdot 1 \\ -2 - 1 \end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -9 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

So $\ell_2$ and $\ell_3$ intersect at $(8, -9, -3)$.
```

## Parallel lines

````{prf:definition} Parallel lines
:label: parallel-lines-definition
 
Two lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by the vector equations $\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{p}_1 + t_1 \mathbf{d}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{p}_2 + t_2 \mathbf{d}_2$ respectively are said to be **parallel** if their direction vectors are parallel; that is, $\mathbf{d_1} = k\mathbf{d_2},$ for some non-zero scalar $k$ ({numref}`parallel-lines-figure`).

```{figure} ../_images/4_parallel_lines.svg
:name: parallel-lines-figure
:width: 500

The lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are parallel in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
```
````

The direction vectors being parallel does not require them to be the same length, hence the condition being merely that one is a scalar multiple of the other (and the value of $k$ could be $1$). The vector only defines a direction, and only in combination with a specified starting point does it define a specific line in space.

In practice the condition from the {prf:ref}`definition of parallel lines<parallel-lines-definition>` can be restated as follows: two lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are parallel if for any two distinct points $\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2 \in \ell_1$ and any two distinct points $\mathbf{q}_1, \mathbf{q}_2 \in \ell_2$: 

$$ \mathbf{p}_2 - \mathbf{p}_1 = k(\mathbf{q}_2 - \mathbf{q}_1), $$

for some non-zero $k \in \mathbb{R}$. This allows us a way to check if two lines are parallel without having to find their direction vectors,  if we know the positions of two points on each line.

```{prf:example}
:label: parallel-lines-example

$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are two lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$, defined by $\{(x,y,z) : z = x+1, y=0\}$ and $\{(x,y,z) : z = -x-1, y=3\}$.

(i) &emsp; Write equations for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ in vector form.

(ii) &emsp; Show that these lines are not parallel in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

```{dropdown} Solution 

(i) &emsp; To calculate the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ we need the coordinates of two points on the line. Choosing $x=0$ and $x=1$, we can use the equations for the two lines to find the two points on the line with those $x$-coordinates, which are $\mathbf{p}_1 = (0, 0, 1)$ and $\mathbf{p}_2 = (1, 0, 2)$ on $\ell_1$. Then we can write

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{d}_1 = \mathbf{p}_2 - \mathbf{p}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} - 
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*} $$

So an equation for $\ell_1$ is:

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 0 \\ 1 + t \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

Similarly, for $\ell_2$ we can find $\mathbf{p}_1 = (0, 3, -1)$ and $\mathbf{p}_2 = (1, 3, -2)$, so:

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{d}_2 = \mathbf{p}_2 - \mathbf{p}_1 = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} - 
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*} $$

so the equation of $\ell_2$ is

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t \\ 3 \\ -1 -t \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

(ii) &emsp; To check if the two lines are parallel, we do not need to know their equations - just their direction vectors. From {prf:ref}`the definition of parallel lines<parallel-lines-definition>`, $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are parallel if $\mathbf{d}_1 = k\mathbf{d}_2$, therefore

$$ \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &= k
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*} $$

This gives us a set of three equations which must simultaneously be satisfied: $1k =1$, $0k=0$ and $1k = -1$. Since these imply that both $k=1$ and $k=-1$, we have a contradiction - so no value of $k$ exists to satisfy $\mathbf{d}_1 = k\mathbf{d}_2$, and so $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are not parallel.

## Skew lines

````{prf:definition} Skew lines
:label: skew-lines-definition

Two distinct lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$, which neither intersect nor are parallel, are called **skew lines** ({numref}`skew-lines-figure`)

```{figure} ../_images/4_skew_lines.svg
:name: skew-lines-figure
:width: 350

The lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are skew lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
```
````

```{prf:example}
:label: skew-lines-example

Show that the lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ from {prf:ref}`parallel-lines-example` are skew lines.

```{dropdown} Solution

We have shown in {prf:ref}`parallel-lines-example` that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are not parallel. Therefore to we need to show that they do not intersect. Equating $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ gives

$$ \begin{align*}
    t_1 &= t_2, \\
    0 &= 3, \\
    -1 &= -1 - t_2.
\end{align*} $$

Here the second equation is a contradiction, so this system is inconsistent and the lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ do not intersect. Since $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are not parallel and do not intersect, they must be skew.
```

```{index} Lines ; perpendicular lines
```

## Perpendicular lines

```{prf:definition} Perpendicular lines
:label: perpendicular-lines-definition

Two lines, $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, are **perpendicular** if their direction vectors $\mathbf{d}_1$ and $\mathbf{d}_2$ are at right angles. We denote this by $\ell_1 \perp \ell_2$.

In $\mathbb{R}^n$ two lines are perpendicular if and only if their direction vectors are perpendicular, which happens precisely when the dot product of the direction vectors is zero.
```

```{prf:example}
:label: perpendicular-lines-example

(i) &emsp; Determine whether the two lines from {prf:ref}`parallel-lines-example` are perpendicular.

(ii) &emsp; Find the equation of a line $\ell_2$ which is perpendicular to $(t,-t,1+t)$ at the point with position vector $\mathbf{p} = (-1,1,0)$.

```{dropdown} Solution

(i) &emsp; The direction vectors from Example 4.3 are $\mathbf{d}_1 = (1, 0, 1)$ and $\mathbf{d}_2 = (1, 0, -1)$. Find the dot product:

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{d}_1 \cdot \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0.
\end{align*} $$

Since this is zero, we know $\ell_1 \perp \ell_2$.

(ii) &emsp; Writing the line $(t,-t,1+t)$ in the form $\mathbf{p}_1 + t \mathbf{d}_1$ we have

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{p}_1 &= \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, &
    \mathbf{d}_1 &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

To find a direction vector perpendicular to $\mathbf{d}_1$ - say, $\mathbf{d}_2$ - we need to satisfy $\mathbf{d}_1 \cdot \mathbf{d}_2 = 0$. Using a general vector for $\mathbf{d}_2, we have:

$$ \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}  \cdot \mathbf{d}_2 = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot 
    \begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\ d_2 \\ d_3 \end{pmatrix} = d_1 - d_2 + d_3 = 0.
\end{align*} $$

This equation has infinitely many solutions, so to choose one we need to pick values for any two from $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_3$ (where at least one is non-zero). Let $d_1 = 1$ and $d_2 = 0$; then we can find $d_3 = -1$. So a possible direction vector for this line is $\mathbf{d}_2 = (1, 0, -1)$. We know $\ell_2$ passes through $\mathbf{p} = (-1, 1, 0)$ and so an equation for $\ell_2$ is:

$$ \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + t
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} -1 + t \\ 1 \\ -t \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$
```

The notion of perpendicularity does not necessarily require that the lines intersect in space. The only requirement is that the direction vectors of the two lines are perpendicular.
