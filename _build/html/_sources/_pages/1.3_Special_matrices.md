# Special matrices

Some matrices have certain properties which makes them useful for various mathematical applications. Understanding special matrices and their properties is important for gaining a deeper insight into linear algebra and its practical applications.

| Square matrix | An $m \times n$ matrix where $m = n$ | $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$ |
| Zero matrix | An $m \times n$ matrix of zeros | $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ |
| Diagonal matrix | A non-zero square matrix where $a_{ij} = 0$ where $i \neq j$ | $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$ |
| Identity matrix | A square matrix $I$ such that $[I]_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1, &i = j, \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$ | $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $ |

```{prf:theorem} Properties of special matrices

- If $A = A^\mathsf{T}$ then $A$ is a symmetric matrix
- If $A$ is an upper triangular matrix, then $A^\mathsf{T}$ is a lower triangular matrix, and vice versa.

We say the zero matrix is the **identity element** or sometimes a **neutral element**, with respect to matrix addition, since it doesn't change the matrix it's added to: i.e., for any $m \times n$ matrix $A$:

- $ A + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} + A = A$

However, for multiplication, it is not neutral:

- $ A \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} A = \mathbf{0}$

The identity matrix is called this because it's the identity element for multiplication:

- $I A = A I = A$

It also allows us to define [inverse matrices](inverse-matrix-section), which we'll cover next:
- $AA^{-1} = I$ where $A^{-1}$ is the inverse of $A$
