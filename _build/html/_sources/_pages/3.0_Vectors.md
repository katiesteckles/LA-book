Vectors are way of expressing quantities that cannot be described by a single number. This could involve a data set with multiple variables, or a geometrical transformation or movement - vectors are often thought of as being an 'arrow' in $n$-dimensional space.

For example, consider the displacement of an object in 2 dimensional space from one location to another: there is a change in the position in one direction, and a change in the position of another, so a single value cannot carry this information. Vectors were originally used in geometry, but have since become important in multivariate calculus, computer graphics, engineering and physics.

### Euclidean space

Before we discuss vectors, it is useful to first define <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space" target="_blank">**Euclidean space**</a> which is the mathematical system in which vectors are most commonly studied. Attributed to the Greek mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid" target="_blank">Euclid</a>, Euclidean space is a representation of physical space where the position of a point in the space can be described by the signed distance along perpendicular real number lines called **axes** (singular: axis).

```{figure} /_images/3_R3.svg
:name: R3-figure

The position of a point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be defined by its co-ordinates $(x, y, z)$.
```

An $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is defined by $n$ perpendicular real axes, and is referred to as $\mathbb{R}^n$. For example, consider the diagram of $\mathbb{R}^3$ in {numref}`R3-figure`. Here we can see a portion of 3-dimensional Euclidean space defined by the 3 axes labelled $x$, $y$ and $z$.

This representation uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule" target="_blank">**right-hand rule**</a>, so-called because if we use the thumb on our right hand to represent the $x$ axis, the index finger for the $y$ axis and the middle finger for the $z$ axis, we can arrange a right hand into this shape.

```{figure} /_images/3_right-hand-rule.png
:name: right-hand-rule
:width: 400

The thumb, index and middle fingers represent $x$, $y$ and $z$ respectively.
```

Doing similar with the left hand gives the **left-hand rule**, where the $x$ axis is pointing in the opposite direction.

The position of a point in Euclidean space can be defined by its **co-ordinates** - an ordered set of numbers, sometimes called a **tuple**, where each element contains the signed distances along each axis. For example, $(x, y, z)$ where $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$. ('Signed' here means that the value has a number, and also a sign, which can be positive or negative).

This system of defining position in space is sometimes also called **Cartesian coordinates**, named after the mathematician and philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" target="_blank">Ren√© Descartes</a>.

### Definition of a Vector

In Euclidean space, a **vector** represents a **displacement** from a point $A$ to a point $B$ ({numref}`vector-figure`). A vector is an object that has a **magnitude** (length) and a **direction**. The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points, and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from $A$ to $B$, with respect to the given Euclidean space. Note that the actual points $A$ and $B$ are not important for the definition of the vector - only the movement required to get from $A$ to $B$. In diagrams, vectors are  often represented by arrows. The start of the vector is sometimes called the **tail**, and the end of the vector (where the arrow is) is called the **head**.

```{figure} /_images/3_vector.svg
:name: vector-figure
:width: 250

The vector pointing from $A$ to $B$.
```

Vectors in mathematical notation are usually denoted by a single lowercase character. To distinguish vectors from other mathematical objects such as scalars and variables, the character representing a vector is written in boldface when typeset, e.g., $\mathbf{a}$ or underlined when written by hand, e.g., $\underline{a}$.

```{important}
Get into the habit of always underlining your vectors when writing by hand. This helps to avoid confusion between vectors and other mathematical objects such as variables, matrices etc.
```

A vector can be represented by a single column or row matrix:

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n\end{pmatrix} = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n),
\end{align*} $$

Here, each element represents the signed difference between the tail and head of the vector in that Cartesian coordinate. The choice of whether to use row or column vectors is arbitrary, but here we will express vectors as column matrices in equations, as it makes it easier when dealing with [linear combination of vectors](linear-combination-of-vectors-section) and [linear transformations](linear-transformations-chapter).

Consider the vector $\mathbf{a}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ as given in the {numref}`R3-vector-figure`. Here the displacement along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes are $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ respectively, therefore $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$.

```{figure} /_images/3_R3_vector.svg
:name: R3-vector-figure
:width: 500

The vector $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
```

We use $\mathbf{0}$ to denote the **zero vector** $(0, 0, \ldots, 0)$. This can be thought of as the vector $A - A$, or the vector from a point $A$ to itself, for any point $A$. In this chapter we introduce vectors in Euclidean space, and so the coefficients $a_i$ will necessarily be real numbers. In the chapter on [vector spaces](vector-spaces-chapter) we will generalise the notion of a vector, and allow its coefficients to be any elements coming from any underlying field.

### Position vectors

A **position vector** $\mathbf{p}$ is a vector that points from the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ to a point in the space ({numref}`position-vector-figure`).

```{figure} /_images/3_position_vector.svg
:name: position-vector-figure
:width: 350

The position vector $\mathbf{p}$ points from the origin $O$ to a point in the space.
```

So if a point has co-ordinates $(x, y, z)$ then the position vector that describes that point is $\mathbf{p} = (x, y, z)$.
