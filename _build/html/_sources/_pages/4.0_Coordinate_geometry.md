The area of mathematics dealing with describing geometry in terms of coordinate systems, hence as points and vectors, is called **coordinate geometry** or **Cartesian geometry** (named after French mathematician and philosopher [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes)). In this chapter we will lay out the basic terminology, and see ways to describe points, lines and planes in $n$ dimensional Cartesian coordinates.

## Points

In his book [* Elements*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements), Euclid described a *point* as *"that which has no part"*. A point has position only - it has no length, width or thickness, and thus no area or volume. A typical point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is described by its co-ordinates $(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)$, where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$.

The position of a point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be defined by its co-ordinates $(x, y, z)$.
