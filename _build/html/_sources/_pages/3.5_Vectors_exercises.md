(a) &emsp; $2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w}$

(b) &emsp; $\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{u}$

(c) &emsp; a unit vector pointing in the same direction of $\mathbf{u}$

(d) &emsp; a unit vector pointing in the opposite direction of $\mathbf{v}$

(e) &emsp; a vector pointing in the same direction as $\mathbf{v}$ but half its length 

(f) &emsp; the vector pointing from $U$ to $V$

(g) &emsp; the vector pointing from $U$ to $W$

(h) &emsp; $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w}$

(i) &emsp; the angle $\angle VUW$

(j) &emsp; show that $\mathbf{u}$ is at right angles to $\mathbf{v}$

(k) &emsp; $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}$

```{exercise}
:label: vectors-ex-linear-combination

Write $\mathbf{u} = (2,7,1)$ as:

(a) &emsp; a linear combination of $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$ and $\mathbf{k}$

(b) &emsp; a linear combination of vectors $\mathbf{f}_1 = (1, -1, 0), \mathbf{f}_2 = (0, 2, 0)$ and $\mathbf{f}_3 = (1, 0, -1)$

```{exercise}
:label: vectors-ex-perpendicular

Find $k$ such that the vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are perpendicular:

(a) &emsp; $\mathbf{u} =(1, k, -2)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (2, -5, 4)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$

(b) &emsp; $\mathbf{u} = (1, 0, k+2, -1, 2)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (1, k, -2, 1, 2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^5$
```

```{exercise}
:label: vectors-ex-angle

Which pair of the following vectors is perpendicular? For the remaining pairs, what is the angle between them?

$$ \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{u} &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, &
    \mathbf{v} &= \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}, &
    \mathbf{w} &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$
