# Vector spaces

We have been working with vectors, and have seen that there are ways to combine vectors and scalars, in ways similar to how we can manipulate matrices, or combine numbers and variables to create algebraic expressions. This similarity is not a coincidence - structures like this exist throughout maths, and we can define them more formally by considering collections of objects within a space that obey particular rules, called a **vector space**.

A vector space consists of a set of objects that satisfy the axioms of vector addition and scalar multiplication. As the name suggests, vectors in [Euclidean space](euclidean-space-section) satisfy these axioms, and can form a vector space - but so do lots of other types of mathematical objects. The term *vectors*, when dealing with vector spaces, could apply to matrices, polynomial functions, numbers etc.

Vector spaces are more abstract than much of the maths you'll be used to. To give a sense of why they're useful, consider these three examples, taken from  Geoffrey Scott's <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/gscott/WhatVS.pdf" target="_blank">why we need vector spaces</a>:

- Problem 1: Find $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ that satisfy

$$ x_1 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + x_2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + x_3 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}. $$

- Problem 2: Find $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$ x_1 (2t^2 - t + 1) + x_2 (t^2 + 2t -2) + x_3 (0t^2 + t) = 2t^2 + 5t + 1.$$

- Problem 3: Find $x_1, x_2, \ldots \in \mathbb{C}$ such that

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n cos(n \pi t) = e^{5nt}. $$

These three problems are each described using three different mathematical objects: Problem 1 uses vectors, problem 2 uses polynomials and problem 3 uses trigonometric functions. But these three problems all involve solving the same kind of problem - finding how many of each of the items to combine to create the desired result, which is fundamentally about solving a system of linear equations.

We know how to solve problem 1 using the methods from the [chapter on systems of linear equations](systems-of-linear-equations-chapter) - so can we use these methods to solve problems 2 and 3 as well, and other problems using different mathematical objects?

In general, when we encounter a situation like this, we could say:

> "Suppose you have a collection of column vectors *or* polynomials *or* functions *or* any other type of mathematical object that can be multiplied by numbers and added together$\ldots$"

Every time we encounter a similar problem to the ones above, we would need to state a theorem about this particular kind of problem and prove it before we can proceed. Instead of considering each of them separately, we define a *vector space* as being made up of any type of mathematical object that can be multiplied by numbers and added together in this way, and can rephrase the above more concisely as:

> "Let $V$ be a vector space $\ldots$"
